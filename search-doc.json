That's the standard aspect ratio for iphone photos and other smartphones or compact cameras.  Only useful if you have chosen an aspect ratio different from 1:1. It will let the layout engine use square frames in some cases to improve the solutions. The solutions will be sorted by symmetry, the first ones will be more symmetric. Symmetric layouts tend to be more aesthetic. Instruct the layout engine if you want full spread solutions where the frames cross the spread center or not. Both: If you want full spread solution and page solutions. Spread: Only full spread solution. Pages: Only page solutions. In case you choose page solutions you can lock one page to keep the current layout in the canvas or even select the exact number of frames you want in each page. None: Don't lock any page.
